### Hi, I'm Uriel.

I am a software developer and computer science student passionate about web technologies.

My professional experience has been focused on the frontend using mainly the following technologies:
- JavaScript
- React
- HTML
- CSS and Sass

Even though my skillset leans towards the frontend, the entire software development stack fascinates me. In order to acquire more skills regarding the backend and polish the ones I have related to the frontend, I enrolled in a Fullstack Development Bootcamp. These are some of the technologies that I have being learning and working with:
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Redis
- TypeORM
- Docker
- styled-components 

I am currently looking for a new oppotunity. You can learn more about my professional experience and contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/urieloalves/)
