# Hi there,

###

My name is Uriel and I am a Software Engineer.

I bring experience across the stack — building robust backend systems with Kotlin and Node.js, and crafting intuitive frontend interfaces with TypeScript and React. At Pleo, I helped migrate the internal billing system and developed a high-reliability cashback service — streamlining critical transactions and supporting business growth.

Earlier in my journey, I contributed to a fullstack project at MVST., applying modern web technologies to create user-focused applications. At Qlaym GmbH, I focused on frontend development for an AI-powered web platform.

I’m now excited for the next chapter. Let’s connect and explore how I can bring value to your team or project!
