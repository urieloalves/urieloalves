# Hi there,

###

My name is Uriel and I am a Software Engineer.

I have professional experience working with Kotlin, a solid understanding of Java, and a strong willingness to learn new programming languages. At Pleo, I played a key role in migrating the internal billing system and developing a cashback service, ensuring seamless transactions and high reliability.

Previously, I worked on fullstack project at MVST., leveraging TypeScript, JavaScript, Node, and React. My journey also includes frontend-focused development at Qlaym GmbH, where I contributed to an AI-driven web application.

Now, I’m looking for my next challenge as a Backend Software Engineer, eager to apply my expertise in backend development to build robust, high-performing systems. 

Let’s connect and explore how I can contribute to your next project!
